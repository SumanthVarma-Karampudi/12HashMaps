-----------------------------------------Bucket Array_Hashfunction & Collision handling-----------------------------------------------------------

Two methods of collision handling:
1. CLOSED HASHING (SEPERATE CHAINING) - when multiple keys go to the same index then they are placed in linked list and the value of the particular
index will be pointing to the starting node of the linked_list called as head.
2. OPEN ADDRESSING - Based on formula
